## Caishen personal finance management API.

Caishen is the god of wealth and money in Chinese mythology, hence the name of the API. This API is part of a full stack Caishen application that consists of a mobile and web front-ends as well as this API. This application has all the expected personal finance features. These include creating and managing accounts, and creating and managing payments for respective accounts. On top of that, and what made me write this in the first place, there is the feature that listens to activities in the user's actual bank account. In my case, it all started with my own bank, Bunq, and its exposed API. Bank's API sends updates to the Caishen API which then displays these payments in the front-end applications. From there on all the user has to do it select a category for the payment and add a description. Traditional personal finance management applications make the user enter all details of a payment manually which can get quite annoying. This application solves this. In addition to being able to manage regular banks, Caishen API also makes it possible to manage crypo wallet accounts.
